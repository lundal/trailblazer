## Trailblazer

Trailblazer is a dynamic web-based character sheet built on AngularJS and Bootstrap.
Character data is stored permanently in the browser using HTML5 Local Storage.

Trailblaze is still in an early development phase.
It is not currently viable for daily use.

#### Offline mode
Since the app does not communicate with any remote host, it can be used offline.
However, since most browsers block JavaScript from accessing files locally, the views have to be added as templates to index.html.
