## Trailblazer

Trailblazer is a dynamic web-based character sheet built on AngularJS and Bootstrap.
Character data is stored permanently in the browser using HTML5 Local Storage.

Trailblaze is still in an early development phase.
It is not currently viable for daily use.

The feat and spell information is not distributed with this project, but fetched from d20pfsrd.com's database during the build process.

#### Getting started
1. Clone/download the repository
2. Add your google drive app id to driveid.txt (optional, required for drive integration)
3. Run make

#### Offline mode
The app can be used offline after it is built by simply opening index.html in your favorite browser.
However, due to browser security measures, drive integration and autocomplete features will not work.
